# Global API Services & Integration Hub

This repository serves as the central documentation and development hub for our global API export initiative. We provide high-performance, edge-computing based API solutions designed for the AI-driven workflow era.

## 🚀 Business Overview
We specialize in providing "Infrastructure as a Service" (IaaS) through lightweight, reliable API endpoints. Our goal is to bridge the gap between complex data processing and automated AI agents/workflows (n8n, Zapier, GitHub Actions).

### Current Service Focus:
- **Data Transformation APIs**: Converting complex web data into AI-readable structured formats.
- **Workflow Automation Tools**: Custom-built endpoints to streamline enterprise repetitive tasks.
- **Developer Utilities**: Essential tools for modern software development and CI/CD pipelines.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
To ensure 99.9% availability and global low-latency, we utilize industry-leading technologies:

- **Financial Infrastructure**: Stripe & Wise
- **Contract Testing**: Ensuring API reliability and backward compatibility.

## 🌐 Compliance & Transparency
We are committed to international tax compliance and service transparency.
